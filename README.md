# Student Event Data Analysis – Cloud Counselage Live Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is part of a live internship under **Cloud Counselage Pvt. Ltd.**, focusing on real-world **Data Analysis**. The dataset contains student responses from various events, including educational background, programming experience, and expected career outcomes.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess student response data.
- Derive meaningful insights through exploratory data analysis.
- Visualize patterns in education, skills, and event participation.
- Identify key factors influencing expected salary and academic performance.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset Summary
The dataset includes:
- Student demographic and academic information
- Event participation details
- Python experience and GPA
- Family income and salary expectations

## 📈 Key Insights
- Average GPA of students: **8.04**
- Most popular event: **Product Design & Full Stack**
- Cities with the highest student participation vary significantly.
- **WhatsApp** is the most effective promotion channel.
- No strong correlation found between family income and GPA.
- Students with leadership skills showed slightly higher expected salaries.

## 🔎 Analysis Highlights
- Null values were imputed using mode values.
- No duplicate records were found.
- Correlation and pair plots helped identify patterns.
- Visualizations such as heatmaps and scatter plots provided better understanding of relationships between attributes.

## 📌 Notable Visualizations
- Relationship between CGPA, family income, and expected salary.
- Python experience distribution.
- City-wise GPA trends.
- Event participation frequency.

## 📍 Conclusion
This analysis provided deep insights into student data trends, helping identify what influences students’ career expectations and event engagement. It also offered hands-on experience in real-world data preprocessing, analysis, and storytelling using visual tools.
